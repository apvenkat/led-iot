First we will update and upgrade our pi. Run

sudo apt-get update -y && sudo apt-get upgrade -y

This will take quite some time, if you are running this for the first time. (~ 1 hour)

Next, we will download the latest version of Node-ARM

wget http://node-arm.herokuapp.com/node_latest_armhf.deb

Install it by running

sudo dpkg -i node_latest_armhf.deb

If everything works fine without issues, you can run

node -v

and you should see the installed Nodeâ€™s version.

Here we use onoff Module for our testing, So install the onoff module by running the command

npm install onoff           

Now you can see the node_modules folder having onoff module inside, Now download the led.js file in the same folder and execute the file using the command

sudo node led.js                 // LED will start blinking
